## Updating
The app is made on GitHub for ease of updating. Currently, the program requires you run git pull to get the newest updates, in the future, the system will automatically pull from GitHub when the Captain Web Services server broadcasts a new update is available

This will allow for super fast bug fixes, security fixes, and new features
